Phew, you're done!

Don't forget to save your responses so that you can reference them when the staff publish the answer key in the spring. If you haven't joined the Discord do that, you'll need it for the second round! The staff will be publishing learning materials for all the categories over the next couple of months, look out for that information in your email and in the discord.

Good luck and happy hacking!
