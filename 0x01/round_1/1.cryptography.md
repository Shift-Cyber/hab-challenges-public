# Cryptography
You may not realize it, but you're using cryptography right now to access this website. Cryptography is all around us and allows for the safe and secure use of not only the internet, but many other aspects of our connected world.


## Questions
### 01-C-NZO3G
[Easy] What is the goal of encryption?
1. [0/0%] Reducing the size of a message so that it can be sent over the internet faster.
2. **[115/96% - correct] Concealing the content of the message to provide confidentiality to the user.**
3. [0/0%] Ensuring that everyone who receives a message can validate who it came from.
4. [5/4%] Transform data so that it can be properly (and safely) consumed by different types of systems.

### 01-C-TPZYF
[Easy] What is the goal of encoding?
1. [14/12%] To create a non-reversable "code" that represents the input without giving away the contents.
2. [2/2%] Encoding and encryption are actually just synonymous terms which we can use interoperably.
3. [99/83%] **[correct] Transform data so that it can be properly (and safely) consumed by different types of systems.**
4. [4/3%] Concealing the content of the message to provide confidentiality to the user.
