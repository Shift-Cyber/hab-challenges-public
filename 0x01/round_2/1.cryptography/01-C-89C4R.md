Cryptography is the practice of keeping information secure and private. It involves using math and special techniques to convert regular information, called plaintext, into secret code, called ciphertext. This makes it hard for others to read the information without the key to decrypt it, which is like a secret code to convert the ciphertext back into plaintext. Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, like credit card numbers and personal information online, and is also used in things like phone and internet communication to keep them private.

## Teaching Points
1. How do we properly setup asymmetric encryption?
2. What do we need to recover to break RSA? How do we do this?
3. Why is RSA secure when properly set up?

## Challenge Prompt
**NON-STANDARD FLAG FORMAT**

Here is an RSA key, sort of; provide p and q as `p;q`, like if p was 11 an q was 7, the flag would be `11;7`.

N = `6176128969`
e = `1187`

## Solution Guide
1. We know that in RSA  N = pq, and therefor the fact that N is "small" means we can bruteforce it relatively quickly
2. Use whatever factoring process you'd like to factor out N into p;q
3. Reformat this into the proper flag format

## Reference Material
### How do we properly setup asymmetric encryption?
Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, involves using two different but mathematically related keys to encrypt and decrypt data. Here are the basic steps to properly set up asymmetric encryption:

1. Generate a key pair: The first step is to generate a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key should be kept secret and known only to the owner, while the public key can be freely distributed.
2. Share the public key: The public key can be shared through a key exchange mechanism, such as a public key infrastructure (PKI), or through direct communication with the intended recipient.
3. Encrypt the data: To encrypt data, the sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only the recipient, who has the corresponding private key, can decrypt the message.
4. Decrypt the data: To decrypt the message, the recipient uses their private key to decrypt the message, which was encrypted with their public key.
5. Protect the private key: It is important to keep the private key secure and protected, as it is the key used for decryption. If the private key is compromised, the security of the entire system is compromised.
6. Use trusted encryption algorithms: It is important to use trusted encryption algorithms, such as RSA or ECC, to ensure the security of the encryption system.
7. Implement appropriate key management: It is important to manage the public and private keys properly, including revoking or regenerating keys when necessary, to ensure the continued security of the encryption system.

By following these steps, asymmetric encryption can be properly set up and used to securely encrypt and decrypt data.

### What do we need to recover to break RSA? How do we do this?
To break RSA encryption, an attacker would need to recover the private key used to encrypt the data. There are several methods that attackers may use to try to recover the private key, including:

1. Brute force: In a brute-force attack, an attacker would try every possible private key until they find the correct one. However, with a strong key size, this method is not practical as the number of possible keys is too large to exhaustively search.
2. Factoring: RSA encryption relies on the fact that factoring large numbers is difficult. If an attacker can factor the public key (which is a product of two large prime numbers), they can recover the private key. This method can be computationally intensive, but specialized algorithms such as the General Number Field Sieve (GNFS) can be used to factor large numbers more efficiently.
3. Timing attacks: An attacker may try to analyze the time it takes for the encryption or decryption operation to complete, and use this information to infer information about the private key. This method can be used to recover the private key in some specific scenarios, but it is generally less effective than other methods.

To protect against these attacks, it is important to use strong key sizes, implement appropriate key management practices, and use trusted encryption algorithms. Additionally, RSA encryption can be combined with other encryption methods, such as symmetric encryption or hashing, to provide additional layers of security.

### Why is RSA secure when properly set up?
RSA is secure when properly set up because it relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large numbers, which is currently believed to be a hard problem for classical computers. This means that for sufficiently large key sizes, it is infeasible for an attacker to recover the private key used for decryption.

Specifically, RSA encryption relies on the fact that it is easy to compute the product of two large prime numbers, but difficult to factor the resulting product back into its prime factors. In the RSA algorithm, the public key consists of a modulus (which is the product of two large prime numbers) and an exponent, while the private key consists of the same modulus and a different exponent.

When a message is encrypted using RSA, it is first converted into a numerical representation, and then encrypted using the public key. To decrypt the message, the private key must be used to undo the encryption process. However, without knowledge of the prime factors of the modulus (which is used to compute the private key), an attacker would need to factor the modulus, which is believed to be difficult for sufficiently large key sizes.

Therefore, if the key size is sufficiently large, and the key management practices are implemented properly, RSA encryption is considered to be secure against attacks by classical computers. However, it is important to note that quantum computers may be able to factor large numbers much more efficiently, which could potentially render RSA insecure. As a result, researchers are actively developing new quantum-resistant encryption algorithms to prepare for this possibility.
