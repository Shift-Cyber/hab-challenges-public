Cryptography is the practice of keeping information secure and private. It involves using math and special techniques to convert regular information, called plaintext, into secret code, called ciphertext. This makes it hard for others to read the information without the key to decrypt it, which is like a secret code to convert the ciphertext back into plaintext. Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, like credit card numbers and personal information online, and is also used in things like phone and internet communication to keep them private.

## Teaching Points
1. How can we send non-printable characters (data)?
2. Where is base-encoding used in computer science?
3. What is Base64? Is 64 the only option?

## Challenge Prompt
Check out 0xFF in the ASCII lookup table...

Oh dang, it isn't there. Well I still need to send you that data, not the text but the actual value 0xFF in computer memory.

Here's an example, decode this, all the data you need is right here:
```

```

## Solution Guide
1. Go to cyberchef
2. Select the from base32 block
3. Select the to text block
4. Input the challenge input and click "cook"

## Reference Material
### What is Base Encoding?
Base encoding is a method of converting data from its raw binary format into a more human-readable format using a set of characters or symbols. It is commonly used to represent binary data in a way that can be easily transmitted or stored, such as in a text file or in an email message. One of the most popular forms of base encoding is Base64, which uses 64 characters from the ASCII character set to represent binary data. Each group of 3 bytes of binary data is converted into 4 characters from the Base64 character set, resulting in a 4/3 expansion of the original data. Base64 is often used to encode binary data that needs to be included in a text-based format, such as email attachments or JSON data. In summary, Base encoding is a way of converting binary data into a more human-readable format using a set of characters or symbols, and Base64, base32 and base16 are the most common forms of base encoding.

### How to Convert Between Base64 and Regular Text?
There are several ways to convert between text and Base64 encoding. One way is to use a built-in or third-party library in the programming language of your choice. Many popular programming languages, such as Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript, have built-in libraries or modules that provide methods for converting between text and Base64. Another way is to use an online converter tool. There are many free online tools available that can convert text to Base64 and vice versa. These tools can be used to quickly convert small amounts of data without having to write any code.

Here is an example of how to convert text to Base64 using Python:
```
import base64

text = "Hello, World!"

# Encode the text to Base64
base64_encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode())

# Decode the Base64 encoded text
base64_decoded = base64.b64decode(base64_encoded).decode()

print("Text:", text)
print("Base64 Encoded:", base64_encoded)
print("Base64 Decoded:", base64_decoded)
```

### CyberChef
CyberChef is a web-based tool that can be used to perform a wide range of data manipulation tasks, including Base64 encoding and decoding.

To convert text to Base64 using CyberChef:
1. Go to the CyberChef website: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
2. In the main window, enter or paste the text that you want to encode in the "Input" field.
3. Scroll down to the "From" section, and select "Text"
4. Scroll down to the "To" section, and select "Base64"
5. Click the "Cook" button.

The encoded Base64 text will be displayed in the "Output" field.

To convert Base64 encoded text back to plain text using CyberChef:

1. Go to the CyberChef website: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
2. In the main window, enter or paste the Base64 encoded text in the "Input" field.
3. Scroll down to the "From" section, and select "Base64"
4. Scroll down to the "To" section, and select "Text"
5. Click the "Cook" button.

The decoded plain text will be displayed in the "Output" field.

CyberChef also allows you to chain operations, so you can perform multiple operations on the data in a single recipe. You can also save the recipe for future use, so you can easily repeat the same operations on different inputs.
