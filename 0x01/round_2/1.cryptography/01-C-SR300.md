*Author: Nate Singer (Helix)*

Cryptography is the practice of keeping information secure and private. It involves using math and special techniques to convert regular information, called plaintext, into secret code, called ciphertext. This makes it hard for others to read the information without the key to decrypt it, which is like a secret code to convert the ciphertext back into plaintext. Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, like credit card numbers and personal information online, and is also used in things like phone and internet communication to keep them private.

## Solution Guide
1. Open the ASCII or Unicode chart
2. Lookup each hex character and translate it back to text

## Reference Material
### What is encoding?
Character encoding is a way computers use to represent text using numbers. Just like how we use the alphabet to write words, computers use a set of numbers called code points to represent letters, numbers, and other characters. When you type a letter on your keyboard, the computer converts that letter into a code point, and when you want to see the letter again, the computer converts the code point back into the letter. There are different types of character encodings, but the most common one is called UTF-8. It can represent almost any character in any language and it's the one used on the internet. So, in short, character encoding is a way for computers to understand and store text we see and use in our daily lives.

### ASCII vs Unicode
ASCII and Unicode are both character encodings, which means they are ways of representing text using numbers. However, there are some key differences between the two. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It was developed in the 1960s and it uses 7 bits (or 1 byte) to represent each character. This means it can only represent 128 different characters, which includes the English alphabet, numbers, and some basic punctuation and control characters. ASCII is not able to handle characters from other languages such as Chinese or Arabic.Unicode, on the other hand, is a more modern and versatile character encoding standard. It uses more than one byte to represent each character, and it can handle over 1 million characters. This includes not only all the characters in ASCII, but also characters from a wide variety of languages, symbols, and emoji. Unicode also includes code points for characters that are not visible, such as control characters that are used for formatting text.

So, in summary, ASCII is an older and more limited character encoding standard, while Unicode is a newer and more versatile standard that can handle a much larger range of characters from different languages and scripts.

### CyberChef

CyberChef is a web-based tool for performing various types of data manipulation, such as encoding/decoding, encryption/decryption, compression/decompression, and many others. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, yet powerful enough to handle a wide range of tasks. CyberChef can be used for tasks such as analyzing and decoding encoded or encrypted data, or for creating custom data manipulation recipes to automate repetitive tasks. It can also be used for forensic analysis, penetration testing, and incident response. CyberChef is open-source and can be run locally or used through a web browser. It is also available as a command-line tool for integration with other tools and scripts.
