*Author: Nate Singer (Helix)*

Cryptography is the practice of keeping information secure and private. It involves using math and special techniques to convert regular information, called plaintext, into secret code, called ciphertext. This makes it hard for others to read the information without the key to decrypt it, which is like a secret code to convert the ciphertext back into plaintext. Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, like credit card numbers and personal information online, and is also used in things like phone and internet communication to keep them private.

## Teaching Points
1. When we really get down to it, what is encoding?
2. How can we crack arbitrary encodings? No password needed.
3. More complex cryptography cracking methods can be simplified.

## Challenge Prompt
Existing encryption is dumb, so I came up with something better. Maybe its a little emotional or whatever, but I feel like you can get through that part...

Breaking this teaches you some of the primative concepts professionals use to attack novel cryptographic algorithms. It also demonstrates in a primative way why we use established and tested ones for real applications. It also loosely relates to a concept called "known plaintext."

In the prompt, there is no punctuation and everything is lowercase alphabetical characters.

## Solution Guide
1. Download the ciphertext and see that there is a longer and shorter part (infer that the second is the flag)
2. Start to infer the ciphertext based on shorter words like 'a' 'the' 'and' etc...
3. Eventually get enough text back to determine the flag

**Prompt is:** "This chart provides a list of the Unicode emoji characters and sequences, with images from different vendors, CLDR name, date, source, and keywords."

**Flag:** "flag{smile_more_smile_bigger}"

| a = 😀 | c = 😁 | d = 🤑 | e = 🤫 | f = 🤐 | g = 🥶 | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| h = 😅 | i = 😇 | j = 🤤 | k = 🤯 | l = 🫡 | m = 🤥 |
| n = 😮‍💨 | o = 😜 | p = 😚 | q = 🤕 | r = 🥰 | s = 😉 |
| t = 🤣 | u = 😶 | v = 🤗 | w = 🤮 | y = 🥳 |

### How are Emoji's Encoded
Emojis are encoded using Unicode, which is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique code point to each character, including emojis. A code point is a number that corresponds to a specific character or symbol, such as the letter "A" or the heart emoji. Unicode assigns a code point to each emoji and assigns it a unique name. For example, the heart emoji has the code point U+2764 and the name "HEAVY BLACK HEART". This code point can then be encoded using different character encoding formats, such as UTF-8 or UTF-16.

When you type an emoji on your keyboard or select it from a list, your device converts it into the corresponding code point and then encodes it using a specific character encoding format. When the encoded data is received by another device, the code point is then decoded and displayed as the corresponding emoji. Many modern devices and operating systems support the display of emojis by default, but older devices or systems may not support all emojis or may display them as a square or other default symbol. In these cases, the device or system may not have the necessary font or mapping to display the encoded emoji.

In summary, emojis are encoded using Unicode, which assigns a unique code point to each character, including emojis. The code point can then be encoded using different character encoding formats such as UTF-8 or UTF-16 and then decoded to display the corresponding emoji on different devices.

### Substitution Ciphers
A substitution cipher is a type of encryption technique that replaces each letter in a plaintext message with a different letter or symbol. The basic idea behind a substitution cipher is to create a mapping between the letters of the plaintext and the letters of the ciphertext, so that each letter of the plaintext is replaced with a different letter or symbol of the ciphertext.

There are different types of substitution ciphers, such as monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers. A monoalphabetic cipher is a simple substitution cipher that uses a fixed mapping between the plaintext and the ciphertext. The mapping can be represented by a table or a key, which shows the correspondence between the plaintext and the ciphertext letters. For example, A might be replaced by D, B might be replaced by E, and so on. A polyalphabetic cipher is a substitution cipher that uses multiple mappings between the plaintext and the ciphertext. The mapping is changed during the encryption process, and the same plaintext letter can be represented by different ciphertext letters at different positions in the message. An example of this is the Vigenere Cipher which uses a key word to change the mapping of the letters at different position in the message. Substitution ciphers are relatively easy to break if the attacker can obtain enough ciphertext and has a good understanding of the language and patterns used in the plaintext. Therefore, substitution ciphers are considered relatively weak encryption methods and are not widely used in modern cryptography.

In summary, a substitution cipher is a type of encryption technique that replaces each letter in a plaintext message with a different letter or symbol, and there are two types of substitution ciphers: monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers. Monoalphabetic ciphers use a fixed mapping between the plaintext and the ciphertext, while polyalphabetic ciphers use multiple mappings that change during the encryption process.

### Plaintext vs Ciphertext
Ciphertext and plaintext are two types of text that are used in the process of encryption and decryption. Plaintext is the original message or data that is to be protected. It is the text in its original, unencrypted form that can be read and understood by anyone. Plaintext is also known as cleartext. Ciphertext is the encoded or encrypted version of the plaintext message. It is the result of applying an encryption algorithm to the plaintext, which transforms the original message into a form that is unreadable and incomprehensible to anyone who does not have the proper decryption key. Ciphertext is also known as encrypted text.

The process of encryption takes the plaintext and applies a set of mathematical algorithms using a specific key to transform the plaintext into ciphertext. The process of decryption takes the ciphertext and applies the same mathematical algorithms using the same key to transform the ciphertext back into the original plaintext.

In summary, plaintext is the original, unencrypted message or data, and ciphertext is the encoded or encrypted version of the plaintext, which is unreadable and incomprehensible to anyone who does not have the proper decryption key. Encryption is the process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext, and decryption is the process of transforming ciphertext back into the original plaintext.
