Networking is the process of connecting different devices like computers and smartphones together so they can communicate and share information. It's like a group of friends sharing information and resources among themselves. Examples of networking include connecting to the internet and connecting computers together in an office or school environment. Networking also involves setting up and maintaining communication protocols, security measures, and other technical aspects to ensure smooth and secure communication among the devices. In summary, networking allows different devices to connect and share information, making it possible to access the internet, share files, and collaborate on projects.

## Solution Guide
1. Find the TCP stream with the flag in it by stepping through the identified streams

## Reference Material
### What is a stream in Wireshark?
In Wireshark, a stream refers to a sequence of packets that belong to the same conversation between two devices over a network.

For example, if two devices are communicating using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a stream in Wireshark would be all the packets involved in that HTTP conversation, including the initial request from the client, the response from the server, and any subsequent requests and responses.

Wireshark groups packets into streams to make it easier for you to follow a particular conversation or transaction between devices. You can view the packets in a stream as a single unit, making it easier to understand what's happening in the conversation.

Wireshark also provides some useful features for analyzing streams, such as the ability to follow a TCP stream or to reassemble fragmented packets in a stream. This can be helpful in troubleshooting network issues and understanding how different devices are communicating with each other.

### How can we see the application data in a Wireshark stream?
To see the application data in a Wireshark stream, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Wireshark and load the capture file that contains the stream you want to analyze.
2. Locate the packet that marks the beginning of the stream. You can usually identify the start of a stream by looking for the initial request from the client or the first response from the server.
3. Right-click on the packet and select "Follow TCP Stream" (if the protocol is TCP) or "Follow UDP Stream" (if the protocol is UDP).
4. A new window will open that shows all of the packets in the stream, reconstructed into a human-readable format. This will include any application data that was sent as part of the stream.
5. You can use the "Find" feature in the window to search for specific keywords or data within the stream, which can be useful for troubleshooting or analyzing the conversation.

By following these steps, you can view the application data in a Wireshark stream and gain a better understanding of the communication between the devices.

### What is the difference between a HTTP and TCP stream in Wireshark?
HTTP and TCP are different protocols, but they are related to each other. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable communication between two devices over a network. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol that uses TCP to transfer data, typically web content, between a client and a server.

In Wireshark, a TCP stream is a sequence of packets that belong to the same TCP connection between two devices. A TCP stream in Wireshark represents the entire conversation between two devices, including any HTTP traffic that may be present.

An HTTP stream, on the other hand, refers to a sequence of packets that belong to the same HTTP conversation between a client and a server. An HTTP stream in Wireshark represents only the HTTP traffic in a TCP stream, and not any other traffic that may be present.

In summary, the main difference between an HTTP stream and a TCP stream in Wireshark is that an HTTP stream only shows the HTTP traffic in a conversation between a client and server, while a TCP stream shows all the packets in a conversation, including the TCP packets that are used to establish and manage the connection.
