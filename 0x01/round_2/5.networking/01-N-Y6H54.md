Networking is the process of connecting different devices like computers and smartphones together so they can communicate and share information. It's like a group of friends sharing information and resources among themselves. Examples of networking include connecting to the internet and connecting computers together in an office or school environment. Networking also involves setting up and maintaining communication protocols, security measures, and other technical aspects to ensure smooth and secure communication among the devices. In summary, networking allows different devices to connect and share information, making it possible to access the internet, share files, and collaborate on projects.

## Teaching Points
1. What is port forwarding?
2. How can we use wireshark to monitor network traffic?
3. How does a webserver know where to send the data back when we make a request?

## Challenge Prompt
There is a service running on `woxuazsgxd.qualifier.hackabit.com:54321`

Connect to it and try to follow the mail...

*you may need to forward some ports*

## Solution Guide
1. Connect to the challenge to trigger the response
2. Use wireshark to capture all traffic coming back on the interface
3. Use port filters to filter for all tcp ports between 5000 and 5500

*You may need to port forward these ports if you haven't yet.*

## Reference Material
### What is port forwarding?
Port forwarding is a technique in computer networking that allows incoming network connections to be forwarded to a specific device on a network. The incoming connections are forwarded based on the port number, which is a unique identifier assigned to each network service.

In port forwarding, a router or firewall is configured to redirect incoming network traffic on a specific port to a specific device on the network. This allows external devices to access network services on the internal device, even if it is not directly reachable from the Internet. For example, if a device on the network is running a web server, port forwarding can be used to redirect incoming traffic on port 80 (the standard port for HTTP) to the device running the web server.

Port forwarding is commonly used to allow remote access to a device on a network, such as a home security camera, a file server, or a media center. It can also be used to bypass firewalls that block certain services, or to improve the security of a network by isolating internal devices from direct access from the Internet.

Overall, port forwarding is a useful technique for network administrators to allow access to network services and improve the security of a network.

### How can we use wireshark to monitor network traffic?
Wireshark is a popular network protocol analyzer that can be used to monitor network traffic. Here are the steps to use Wireshark to monitor network traffic:

1. Install Wireshark: Wireshark can be downloaded and installed on most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. Start Wireshark: Once installed, start Wireshark by clicking on the icon or using the command line interface.
3. Select the network interface to monitor: Wireshark provides a list of all available network interfaces, including Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and other types of interfaces. Select the interface that you want to monitor.
4. Start capturing network traffic: To start capturing network traffic, click on the "Start" button in Wireshark. You will see a real-time display of all network packets that are transmitted over the selected network interface.
5. Filter network traffic: To make it easier to find specific network packets, you can use Wireshark's filter system to display only the network packets that match certain criteria. For example, you can filter by IP address, port number, protocol, or packet size.
6. Analyze network traffic: Wireshark provides a detailed view of each network packet, including the source and destination addresses, packet size, protocol, and payload data. You can use this information to analyze network traffic patterns, troubleshoot network issues, and optimize network performance.
7. Save and export network traffic: If you need to analyze network traffic later or share it with others, you can save the captured network traffic to a file, and export it in various formats, such as CSV, XML, or PCAP.

By following these steps, you can use Wireshark to monitor network traffic and gain valuable insights into network performance and behavior.

### How does a webserver know where to send the data back when we make a request?
A web server knows where to send the data back to the client (i.e., the source of the request) by using the information contained in the request itself.

When a client makes a request to a web server, it sends an HTTP request message that contains several pieces of information, including the target URL, the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), and the client's IP address and port number.

The web server uses the client's IP address and port number to determine the address to send the response back to. The response is sent back to the IP address and port number specified in the request, and the client is able to receive the response because it is listening on that address and port.

In this way, the web server is able to "know" where to send the response back to the client by using the information contained in the request. This process happens every time a client makes a request to a web server, and it allows for two-way communication between the client and server.
