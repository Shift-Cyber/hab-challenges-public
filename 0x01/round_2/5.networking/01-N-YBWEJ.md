Networking is the process of connecting different devices like computers and smartphones together so they can communicate and share information. It's like a group of friends sharing information and resources among themselves. Examples of networking include connecting to the internet and connecting computers together in an office or school environment. Networking also involves setting up and maintaining communication protocols, security measures, and other technical aspects to ensure smooth and secure communication among the devices. In summary, networking allows different devices to connect and share information, making it possible to access the internet, share files, and collaborate on projects.

## Teaching Points
1. What is Wireshark?
2. How can we get capture statistics in Wireshark?
3. What is an operating system Kernel and why is it important?

## Challenge Prompt
**NON-STANDARD FLAG FORMAT**

*All 75 and 100 point networking challenges use capture-1.pcapng*

What is the kernel(OS) was this network capture recorded on? 

## Solution Guide
1. Go to statistics -> general
2. The kernel should be available here

## Reference Material
### What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a computer program that allows you to see and analyze the data that is being sent over a network. It can help you understand how different devices on the network are communicating with each other and can be useful for troubleshooting network problems. 

### How can we get capture statistics in Wireshark?
To get capture statistics in Wireshark, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Wireshark and start capturing network traffic by clicking on the "Capture" button.
2. Once you've captured the traffic you want to analyze, stop the capture by clicking on the "Stop" button.
3. From the main menu, click on "Statistics" and select the type of statistics you want to view, such as "Summary" or "Conversations."
4. You can also choose to apply a display filter to view statistics for specific types of network traffic, such as HTTP or TCP.
5. The capture statistics will be displayed in a new window, and you can use them to analyze the network traffic and troubleshoot any issues.

### What is an operating system Kernel and why is it important?
An operating system kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages system resources and provides basic services to other parts of the operating system and software applications. It is responsible for managing computer memory, input/output (I/O) operations, scheduling tasks, and controlling access to hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices.

The kernel is important because it provides a foundation for the entire operating system, enabling different software programs and applications to run on top of it. Without the kernel, it would be impossible for the operating system to communicate with hardware devices, allocate system resources, or manage user tasks.

Moreover, the kernel provides security and protection for the computer system by controlling access to hardware resources and memory. It is also responsible for managing errors, bugs, and other issues that can occur in the operating system.

Overall, the kernel is a critical component of an operating system and plays a vital role in enabling the functionality and stability of a computer system.
