Web applications, also known as "web apps," are software programs that run on the internet. They can be accessed using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Safari, on any device that has internet access. Web apps can do many things, like let you check your email, shop online, or play games. They are different from traditional desktop apps that you have to install on your computer. Web apps are built using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they run on servers that are connected to the internet. Examples of web apps include Google Docs, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Teaching Points

## Challenge Prompt
- [easy] How a basic webserver works (html, javascript, css)

store pieces of the flag across the three files, comments or something

## Solution Guide
1. Visit the page and view source/inspect element
2. Determine that there are a few files being used either via source or network monitor
3. Visit the html, js, and css files to pull the three pieces of the flag

## Reference Material
### What is inspect element?
Inspect element is a feature in web browsers that allows users to view and edit the HTML and CSS code of a webpage in real-time. It can be used to troubleshoot issues with a webpage, make temporary changes to the layout or design, and inspect the structure and properties of individual elements on the page. It is typically accessed by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu.

### What are the common resources used by a web application?
The three common resources used by web apps to display pages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the content of a webpage and define the different elements on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout and design of a webpage, including the colors, fonts, and spacing of elements.
3. JavaScript is a programming language that allows web developers to create interactive and dynamic effects on a webpage, such as form validation, animations, and responsive design.

### What does a web browser actually do as opposed to the server?
The web browser and web server are two separate but connected components of the World Wide Web (WWW) that work together to display web pages to users. A web browser is a software application that runs on a user's device, such as a computer or smartphone. It is responsible for sending requests to web servers for web pages and other resources, and then interpreting and displaying the information received. When a user types a URL into the browser's address bar or clicks on a link, the browser sends a request to the server where the requested page is located. A web server, on the other hand, is a computer or a software that runs on a computer and is responsible for receiving requests from browsers and sending back the requested information. Web servers are connected to the internet and store web pages and other resources, such as images and videos, that are requested by browsers.

In short, the browser makes a request to the server, the server finds the requested web page and sends it back to the browser, the browser receives the web page, interprets it and displays it to the user. This process happens every time a user requests a web page through the browser.
