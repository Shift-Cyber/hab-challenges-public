Web applications, also known as "web apps," are software programs that run on the internet. They can be accessed using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Safari, on any device that has internet access. Web apps can do many things, like let you check your email, shop online, or play games. They are different from traditional desktop apps that you have to install on your computer. Web apps are built using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they run on servers that are connected to the internet. Examples of web apps include Google Docs, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Reference Material
### What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on a user's device when they visit the site. Cookies are used to remember user preferences, login information, and browsing history, among other things. They can also be used to track users across different sites. Cookies can be deleted or blocked by adjusting the settings in a web browser.

### How can a web application store and pass data?
There are several ways that a web application can store and pass data:

1. Cookies: As mentioned earlier, cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device by a website. They can be used to store small amounts of data, such as user preferences or login information.
2. Session Storage: It is similar to cookies, but it is stored on the client-side and is specific to a single browser tab or window.
3. Local Storage: It is similar to session storage, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed.
4. Database: Web applications can store data in a database, such as MySQL or MongoDB, and retrieve it as needed. This is often used for large amounts of data or data that needs to be kept for an extended period of time.
5. API: Web applications can also pass data to and from other web applications using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This allows different applications to share data and functionality.
6. GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP methods: these methods of HTTP protocol can be used to send data to the server and retrieve data from the server.

The specific method used to store and pass data will depend on the requirements of the application and the amount and type of data being stored.

### How can I inspect web application data stores?
You can inspect stored data in a web application by using the developer tools built into your web browser.

1. For Cookies: You can inspect cookies by going to the "Developer Tools" or "Inspect Element" option in your browser's menu, and then selecting the "Application" or "Storage" tab. This will display a list of all the cookies associated with the website, including their name, value, and expiration date.
2. For Local Storage and Session Storage: You can inspect Local Storage and Session Storage by going to the "Developer Tools" or "Inspect Element" option in your browser's menu, and then selecting the "Application" or "Storage" tab. This will display a list of all the Local Storage and Session Storage associated with the website, including their name, value, and expiration date.
3. For Database: You can inspect the data stored in a database by connecting to the database using a management tool, such as MySQL Workbench or MongoDB Compass. This will allow you to view and edit the data stored in the database.
4. For API: You can inspect data passed through an API by using a tool such as Postman, it allows you to view and edit the request and response data as well as testing the API endpoints.

Please note that in order to inspect the data, you need to have the necessary access and permissions. Also, please note that depending on the platform and the stack of the web application, the way of inspecting the data might vary.
