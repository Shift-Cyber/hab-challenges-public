Web applications, also known as "web apps," are software programs that run on the internet. They can be accessed using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Safari, on any device that has internet access. Web apps can do many things, like let you check your email, shop online, or play games. They are different from traditional desktop apps that you have to install on your computer. Web apps are built using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they run on servers that are connected to the internet. Examples of web apps include Google Docs, Facebook, and Instagram.
