## Reference Material
### What is a search engine?
A search engine is a tool that helps you find information on the internet. It works by looking at all the websites on the internet and saving information about them, like the words on the website and the links to other websites. When you use a search engine, like Google or Bing, you type in words or phrases that describe what you're looking for, and the search engine looks at all the information it has saved and shows you the websites that it thinks are most relevant to your search. This way, you can find the information you need quickly and easily, without having to go through every website on the internet one by one.

### What are Google dorks?
Google Dorks, also known as Google hacking, are advanced search queries that use specific operators and keywords to find specific types of information on the internet, such as specific files, vulnerable websites, or sensitive information. These queries take advantage of the way Google's search algorithm works to uncover information that may not be easily accessible through regular search methods. Google Dorks can be used for both legitimate purposes, such as finding publicly available information for research or security testing, or for malicious purposes, such as searching for vulnerabilities in a website or stealing sensitive information.

### What is Web3?
Web3 is a new way of using the internet that allows people to own and control their own information and digital assets, instead of having a centralized company or organization control it. It uses new technology called blockchain, which is like a digital ledger that keeps track of all transactions and information in a secure and decentralized way. This means that no single person or group has control over the information, making it more secure and fair for everyone.
