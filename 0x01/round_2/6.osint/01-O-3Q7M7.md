Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to send and receive short messages called "tweets". Tweets are limited to 280 characters, and can include text, images, videos, and links. Users can also "retweet" or "like" tweets posted by other users. Twitter is also a real-time communication platform, which means that tweets are visible to all users immediately after they are posted. Additionally, users can follow other users to see their tweets in their own timeline. Twitter is a popular platform for individuals, organizations, and businesses to share news, opinions, and updates.
