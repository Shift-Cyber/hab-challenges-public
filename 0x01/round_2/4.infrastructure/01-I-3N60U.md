Cloud computing is a way to use the internet to access and store data and software remotely. Instead of keeping files and programs on your own computer, you can access them through the internet on remote servers. This means you can access your files and programs from any device with an internet connection. It's like renting a space in a big computer building instead of having your own computer. It can also allow for cloud-based software that multiple users can access and collaborate on simultaneously. Cloud computing makes it easy to access and store data and software remotely.

## Teaching Points
1. What is Git?
2. How is Git different than GitHub?
3. Does deleting a file ensure that its gone from a git repository?

## Challenge Prompt
"Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.""

**Flag:** flag{don't_try_harder...look_harder}

## Solution Guide
1. Download the repository
2. Inspect the commits and find a "flag stuff" commit
3. Checkout/revert to this commit and locate the flag

## Reference Material
### What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is widely used in software development and is considered the most popular version control system in use today.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, the same person who created the Linux operating system. Git allows multiple users to collaborate on the same codebase without interfering with each other's work. It tracks changes to files and directories, and stores them in a special database called a repository.

With Git, developers can easily create and switch between different versions of their code, merge changes from different users, and undo changes that caused issues. This makes it easier to manage complex software projects and collaborate with other developers.

Git is a command-line tool, but there are also graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available for those who prefer a visual interface. It can be used on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are popular online hosting services that use Git as their version control system. These platforms allow developers to store and share their code with others, collaborate on projects, and contribute to open-source software.

### How is Git different than GitHub?
Git and GitHub are related, but they are not the same thing. Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to manage changes to code, while GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories.

Git is a command-line tool that developers use to track changes to files and directories in a codebase. It allows them to create multiple versions of their code and collaborate with other developers by merging changes and resolving conflicts. Git repositories can be hosted on any server or computer, and developers can work on them independently, even when they are not connected to the internet.

GitHub, on the other hand, is an online hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for developers to store and share their code with others, collaborate on projects, and contribute to open-source software. GitHub makes it easy to manage repositories, track changes, and collaborate with other developers using a graphical user interface. It also provides additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and code review.

GitHub is not the only online hosting service for Git repositories; other popular services include GitLab and Bitbucket. However, GitHub is the largest and most widely used, with millions of users and millions of repositories hosted.

In summary, Git is a version control system that developers use to manage changes to their code, while GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories that makes it easy to collaborate on projects and share code with others.

### Does deleting a file ensure that its gone from a git repository?
No, deleting a file from a local Git repository does not necessarily ensure that it is gone from the repository's history. When a file is added to a Git repository, it is tracked and recorded in the repository's history. Even if the file is later deleted from the working directory or from a specific commit, its history may still exist in the repository's commit log and in the previous versions of the file that were committed.

If you want to completely remove a file from a Git repository, including its history, you need to use a combination of Git commands to remove the file and rewrite the repository's history.
