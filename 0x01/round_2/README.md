## Categories
### Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice of keeping information secure and private. It involves using math and special techniques to convert regular information, called plaintext, into secret code, called ciphertext. This makes it hard for others to read the information without the key to decrypt it, which is like a secret code to convert the ciphertext back into plaintext. Cryptography is used to protect sensitive information, like credit card numbers and personal information online, and is also used in things like phone and internet communication to keep them private.

### Web
Web applications, also known as "web apps," are software programs that run on the internet. They can be accessed using a web browser, like Google Chrome or Safari, on any device that has internet access. Web apps can do many things, like let you check your email, shop online, or play games. They are different from traditional desktop apps that you have to install on your computer. Web apps are built using programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they run on servers that are connected to the internet. Examples of web apps include Google Docs, Facebook, and Instagram.

### Programming
Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow using a specific language. These instructions, called code, tell the computer what to do, like creating a game or displaying information on a website. There are many different programming languages, each with their own rules and syntax. Once the code is written, it needs to be run or executed so the computer can follow the instructions. Programming is used in many fields and is a powerful tool to automate tasks, solve problems, and create new things.

### Infrastructure
Cloud computing is a way to use the internet to access and store data and software remotely. Instead of keeping files and programs on your own computer, you can access them through the internet on remote servers. This means you can access your files and programs from any device with an internet connection. It's like renting a space in a big computer building instead of having your own computer. It can also allow for cloud-based software that multiple users can access and collaborate on simultaneously. Cloud computing makes it easy to access and store data and software remotely.

### Networking
Networking is the process of connecting different devices like computers and smartphones together so they can communicate and share information. It's like a group of friends sharing information and resources among themselves. Examples of networking include connecting to the internet and connecting computers together in an office or school environment. Networking also involves setting up and maintaining communication protocols, security measures, and other technical aspects to ensure smooth and secure communication among the devices. In summary, networking allows different devices to connect and share information, making it possible to access the internet, share files, and collaborate on projects.

### OSINT
OSINT stands for Open-Source Intelligence, it's information that can be found in publicly available sources like websites, social media, news articles, etc. It's like using Google or other search engines to find information on the internet. OSINT can be used by many people and organizations like journalists, researchers, and even law enforcement agencies. It can be used to gather information on a variety of topics, such as a person's background, the latest news, or even a company's financial information. It is a way of finding information that is publicly available and can be useful for research, investigations, and many other purposes.

## Writeups
A core component of competing in Capture the Flag competitions is writeups for challenges. This reenforces learning and ensures that competitors get as much out of the challenges as possible. This year competition staff offered $20 vouchers from the generous sponsor [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/) for quality submissions. HaB staff are incredibly proud of the quality submissions we received and are happy to host them here for you to review. Please see the following submissions, in no particular order--they are also listed on individual source materials.
