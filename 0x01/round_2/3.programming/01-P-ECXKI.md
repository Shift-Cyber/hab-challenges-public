Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow using a specific language. These instructions, called code, tell the computer what to do, like creating a game or displaying information on a website. There are many different programming languages, each with their own rules and syntax. Once the code is written, it needs to be run or executed so the computer can follow the instructions. Programming is used in many fields and is a powerful tool to automate tasks, solve problems, and create new things.

## Teaching Points
1. What is an interpreter?
2. What are the top interpreted languages?
3. What are magic bytes?

## Challenge Prompt
Grab this file and check it out. You'll notice that it's Python3! Python is an interpreted language, you can read the code but it'll be easier to just interpret it!

This challenge is juxtaposed to Pancake, which is compiled code. Once you interpret this code with the Python3 interpreter, try to read it and see if you understand what it's doing as a bonus!

## Reference Material
### What is an interpreter?
An interpreter is a program that directly executes code written in a high-level programming language, typically line-by-line, without the need for compilation. The interpreter reads the source code and translates each instruction into machine language on the fly, executing it immediately. This allows for rapid development and testing of code, but may be slower than compiled languages at runtime.

### What are the top interpreted languages?
Some of the most popular interpreted programming languages are:

1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. Ruby
4. PHP
5. Perl
6. Lisp
7. Tcl
8. R
9. MATLAB
10. Shell scripts (such as Bash, Zsh, etc.)

Note that some of these languages can also be compiled, depending on the specific implementation or use case.

### What are magic bytes?
Magic bytes (also known as magic numbers) are a sequence of bytes at the beginning of a file or data stream that uniquely identify the file format or encoding. These bytes are used by software programs to quickly determine the type of data contained in a file, without having to rely on the file extension or other external clues.

For example, the magic bytes for a JPEG image file are 0xFF, 0xD8 at the beginning of the file, while the magic bytes for a PNG image file are 0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A.

Magic bytes are often used by file format specifications and software libraries to ensure that a file is of the expected format before attempting to read or write it.
