Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow using a specific language. These instructions, called code, tell the computer what to do, like creating a game or displaying information on a website. There are many different programming languages, each with their own rules and syntax. Once the code is written, it needs to be run or executed so the computer can follow the instructions. Programming is used in many fields and is a powerful tool to automate tasks, solve problems, and create new things.

## Teaching Points
1. How do I connect to a TCP socket for harnessing exploits?
2. Can programming can allow you to automate over the internet?
3. What is a socket?

## Challenge Prompt
Think of this challenge like a bolt and go build a wrench.

Here's your blueprint:
1. Connect to the server on `1.2.3.4:54321` and get your challenge input.
2. Add up all the decimal integers and only the decminal integers, no hex numbers or strings count
3. Send that result back within 3 seconds to get the flag

## Solution Guide
1. Use pwntools or raw sockets to get and send data
2. Add the things up
3. With the result send it and get the flag

See the `solve.py` file

## Reference Material
### How can I receive and send data to a socket in python?
You can receive and send data to a socket in Python using the socket module. Here's an example of a simple Python script that receives data from a socket and then sends a response:

```
import socket

# Create a TCP socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect to the target host and port
sock.connect(('host.example.com', 80))

# Receive data from the socket
data = sock.recv(1024)

# Print the received data
print(data.decode())

# Send a response to the socket
sock.sendall('Hello from Python!'.encode())

# Close the socket
sock.close()
```

In this example, the socket module is used to create a TCP socket. The connect() method is used to connect to the target host and port. The recv() method is then used to receive data from the socket, with the argument 1024 specifying the maximum number of bytes to receive. The received data is decoded using the decode() method and printed. The sendall() method is used to send a response to the socket, with the data encoded using the encode() method. Finally, the close() method is used to close the socket.


### What are python bytestrings and how are they different from normal strings?
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, represented by the str type. However, when working with sockets or other low-level binary APIs, it is often necessary to send or receive data in the form of bytes rather than characters. For this purpose, Python provides the bytes type, which represents a sequence of integers in the range 0 to 255.

A string can be converted to a bytestring using the encode() method, which encodes the string using a specified encoding (such as UTF-8 or ASCII). For example:

```
string = "Hello, world!"
bytestring = string.encode()
```

A bytestring can be converted back to a string using the decode() method, which decodes the bytestring using the specified encoding. For example:
```
bytestring = b'Hello, world!'
string = bytestring.decode()
```

It's important to note that not all strings can be encoded to bytestrings using a specific encoding. For example, some characters may not be representable in the encoding, in which case a UnicodeEncodeError will be raised. Additionally, some characters may be represented differently in different encodings, so it's important to choose the appropriate encoding for your use case.

### What is pwntools?
`pwntools` is a Python framework for creating and manipulating binary payloads, exploiting vulnerabilities, and testing security systems. It provides a high-level and convenient API for many common tasks in the field of security and exploitation, such as creating network connections, sending and receiving data, converting between different data formats, and many others.

`pwntools` is particularly useful for CTF (Capture the Flag) events and other security challenges where you need to quickly write and test code for exploiting vulnerabilities. The framework is designed to be easy to use and it can greatly simplify the process of writing and testing exploits, making it a popular choice among security researchers and competitive hackers.

`pwntools` can be installed using the `pip` package manager by running `pip install pwntools`. Once installed, you can import the `pwn` module and start using the framework in your Python scripts.

### What is TCP socket?
An IP address is like a street address for a house. It's a unique number that tells the internet where to find a specific computer or device. Just like a street address, every device on the internet has a unique IP address.

A port is like an apartment number. Just like an apartment building has multiple units, a single computer can have multiple programs or services running at the same time. Each program or service listens on a specific port number, just like each apartment has a unique number.

So when you send a message over the internet, you need to specify both the IP address and the port number of the computer you're sending the message to. This is like addressing an envelope with a street address and apartment number. The IP address tells the internet where to find the building, and the port number tells it which apartment to deliver the message to.

In this way, IP addresses and ports work together to make sure that your message gets delivered to the right place, just like a street address and apartment number work together to make sure your mail gets delivered to the right place.

A TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) socket is like a phone call between two people. Just like you need a phone to call someone, you need a TCP socket to send information between computers on the internet. Think about it like this: when you make a phone call, you dial a number to reach a specific person. Similarly, when you use a TCP socket, you connect to another computer using a specific IP address and port number.

Just like in a phone call, when you use a TCP socket, you can send messages back and forth between the computers. And just like a phone call, the messages sent through a TCP socket are delivered in the order they were sent, and if any message gets lost, the sender will be asked to send it again.

This way, you can be sure that the information you send over the internet will get to the right place and that the information you receive is correct and complete. That's what TCP sockets do: they provide a reliable way for computers to communicate with each other over the internet.
