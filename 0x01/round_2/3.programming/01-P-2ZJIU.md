Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow using a specific language. These instructions, called code, tell the computer what to do, like creating a game or displaying information on a website. There are many different programming languages, each with their own rules and syntax. Once the code is written, it needs to be run or executed so the computer can follow the instructions. Programming is used in many fields and is a powerful tool to automate tasks, solve problems, and create new things.

## Teaching Points
1. Sorting algorithms are a major componenet of the modern internet
2. Sorting efficiency is incredibly important with large datasets
3. If you fail to sort properly it may not be possible to even process a dataset

## Challenge Prompt
**NON-STANDARD FLAG FORMAT**

You probably shouldn't do this one by hand... Instead write a sorting algorithm that efficiently organizes this file of numbers smallest to biggest. Your flag is the 52133rd number once sorted, starting from 0. Ie: `sorted_numbers[52133]`.

On an average computer, an efficient algorithm should be able to solve this in around 10 seconds.
