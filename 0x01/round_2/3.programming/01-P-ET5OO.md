Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow using a specific language. These instructions, called code, tell the computer what to do, like creating a game or displaying information on a website. There are many different programming languages, each with their own rules and syntax. Once the code is written, it needs to be run or executed so the computer can follow the instructions. Programming is used in many fields and is a powerful tool to automate tasks, solve problems, and create new things.
