1. How do we submit data that cant be a flag?
2. Will I know if a challenge has a normal or weird flag?

## Challenge Prompt
**NON-STANDARD FLAG FORMAT**

This is what a challenge with a non-standard flag will look like. These types of flags are generally used for things like IP addresses or other data that would be a "short answer" style. The challenge will always be marked with a "NON-STANDARD FLAG FORMAT" identifier if it is this way.

Submit the flag `192.168.1.1/24` to get credit for this challenge.
