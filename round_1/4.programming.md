# Programming
Computers are really just hunks of metal. Programmers take those hunks of metal and configure them to do interesting and useful things. While the topic of programming can be quite broad, lets dive into a few important areas.

### 01-P-3K4H0
[Medium] What is the difference between an interpreter and compiler?
1. Interpreted files run faster than compiled files and therefore we generally prefer to use interpreted languages.
2. A compiler converts converts source code to machine code while an interpreter executes source code in real time.
3. Compilers and interpreters are synonomous, there is no difference between compilers and interpreters.
4. Once a program is compiled you still require the source code to run the application.
